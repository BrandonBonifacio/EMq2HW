# HMC PHYS051 TeX and PDF homework for the second quarter
I haven't checked through these files thoroughly to ensure they are correct, so watch out for errors!
Please email me (okellygraves@hmc.edu) if you find any errors and I'll try to fix them as soon as I can.
If someone emails me that they've checked through a file,
I'll add that to a commit message for that homework so others won't have to check through as much.
